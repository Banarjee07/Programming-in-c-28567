//Using define:

# include <stdio.h>
# define PI  3.1416  //constant declaration//
int main () {
float r, Area;
r = 10;
Area = PI * r * r;
printf ("Area is = %f", Area);
return 0;
}

Output:
Area is = 314.160004



//Using const:

# include <stdio.h>
int main () {
const float PI = 3.1416; //constant declaration//
float r, Area;
r = 10;
Area = PI * r * r;
printf (" Area is = %f", Area);
return 0;
}


Output:
Area is = 314.159973
